                                        You also met someone you like.
                                        Got married.
                                        Had a child.

                                        Why did you choose to have children? You think that is a matter of course.  After getting married, you have children.

                                        In the early stages of pregnancy, you 
                                        started to prepare application materials 
                                        for a birth permit. <br>

                                        Other than that, you still need proof that you haven’t had a child before. You went to your company’s infirmary, also the family planning department during the one–child policy.
                                        <br> <br>

                                        “Wow, congrats! Am I the first person to know that in the company?”
                                        "Of course!"

                                        Besides, a deposit of 3,000 yuan is required to ensure that you will place an IUD after giving birth. That's your two months’ salaries.

                                    went to the hospital for IUD insertion.

                                    Since the health insurance includes family planning, the operation is free.
                                    You started to feel nervous when you were registering for the appointment. The nurse confirmed with you that the insertion must happen three days after menstruation, and 
                                    she gave you a document of postoperative precautions to avoid infection.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Lying on the gynecological chair after a simple checkup you were still nervous, and hadn’t realized that the insertion was over. “Finished. 
                                    You can get up now,” said the doctor.

                                    a month.” Getting out of the operating room, 
                                    you rested in the chair outside for half an hour, and then took the bus home.

                                        a ring to a T shape.
