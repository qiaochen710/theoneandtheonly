                    <div class="stext">You are the second child in the family. 
                        The year your mother was pregnant, the family planned to give you away because they already had a daughter and wanted another boy. They asked around for a long time. 
                        One day another couple came to adopt you. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        They have three boys and still wanted a girl. They also have secured jobs which make them seem like a good family. But your father suddenly changed his mind, because you were born at midnight. 
                        <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br>  <br>
                        
                         Everyone said so. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        Because of that, you were able to grow up with your biological family. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        A few years later, people working at the village committee informed your mom that a family planning staff in the town would come to visit in the afternoon. Your mother told you, “Go out to play, remember not to come back before they leave.”

                            The potato seedlings in the field are all blooming with white flowers. You secretly picked a handful, hid under the banyan tree on the side of the mountain, and made a wreath. The sky gradually darkened. Occasionally the dog barked, bugs chirped and bullfrogs croaked on the mountain. 
                            You were still hiding under the banyan tree when night fell.
                            <br> <br>
                            “Why don’t you come home yet?” your mom shouted across the potato field.
                            “I dared not……” and yet you run home quickly.

                                    After graduating from university, you found 
                                    a secure, well–paid job.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Fell in love.

                                    Fell in love again.
                                    Got married.

                                    From the age of 26, people around you started to urge you to have children, intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly. In a call with your mom, she urged you to have a baby. she said, 
                                    “I went to the market to get groceries today and 
                                    I passed by a children’s clothing store on my way home. The clothes inside are so cute.”
                                    “Mom. You don’t need to urge me to have a baby like this.”
                                    “They are really cute! It’s a pity that I haven’t had a chance to buy them yet.” </div>

At the age of 28, you were trying to 
settle down. Your husband and you have 
been saving money for the down payment 
on the house.
<br> <br>
“Let’s talk about the baby after I get 
the house.” You replied evasively.
<br> <br>
Four years later, you got your wish, paid the down payment, and borrowed the loan, and the pressure to have a child intensified. 
<br> <br>
“You said before, after you bought the 
condo, you will have a baby. No backing out.” 
Your mother said.
