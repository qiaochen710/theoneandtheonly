                    <div class="stext" id="s1text">You are the second child in the family. 
                        The year your mother was pregnant, the family planned to give you away because they already had a daughter and wanted another boy. They asked around for a long time. 
                        One day another couple came to adopt you. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        They have three boys and still wanted a girl. They also have secured jobs which make them seem like a good family. But your father suddenly changed his mind, because you were born at midnight. 
                        <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br>  <br><br>  <br>
                        
                         Everyone said so. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        Because of that, you were able to grow up with your biological family. 
                        <br>  <br>
                        A few years later, people working at the village committee informed your mom that a family planning staff in the town would come to visit in the afternoon. Your mother told you, “Go out to play, remember not to come back before they leave.”

                            The potato seedlings in the field are all blooming with white flowers. You secretly picked a handful, hid under the banyan tree on the side of the mountain, and made a wreath. The sky gradually darkened. Occasionally the dog barked, bugs chirped and bullfrogs croaked on the mountain. 
                            You were still hiding under the banyan tree when night fell.
                            <br> <br>
                            “Why don’t you come home yet?” your mom shouted across the potato field.
                            “I dared not……” and yet you run home quickly.

                                    On the bus to the city,  you felt excited and nervous. That is the world you were always looking forwards. You were going to be those stylish grown-ups who will came back to home town every years with gifts for everyone.</div>

                                    You also worked part–time while you were in college. You started to earn and save money.
                                    At the end of the year, you sent some money 
                                    to your family. Even though it’s not a large amount, it proves that you can support yourself while studying and also improve your family’s financial situation a bit.
