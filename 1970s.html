                                    A month after the delivery, you went home with your elder son, leaving the baby with 
                                    your parents’.

                                    When your neighbour met you in the market one day, “Where have you been all these days?” She asked.
                                    “My mom got sick. I went back to take care 
                                    of her. She’s fine now.”<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>

You heard from one of your friends that there was a hospital that didn’t need the birth certification. You called the hospital before you went to make sure if that was true.
                                        <br><br>
                                        “No. You don’t need to bring your birth certification.”

                                        And yes, you went and decided to deliver here.
                                        You dared not bring the baby home, because of the neighbours. Instead, you brought the baby 
                                        to your parents’ after being discharged.
                                        <br><br>
                                        You were tired and scared to be pregnant again. You went to the hospital for an IUD insertion later.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Years later, during the national census, the penalty for the second child was 50% off. 
                                        You registered for your daughter.<br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
