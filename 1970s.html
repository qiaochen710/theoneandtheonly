                                    all day so that no one would know you were pregnant and report you for money.

                                    A month after the delivery, you went home with your elder son, leaving the baby with

                                        You dared not bring the baby home, because of the neighbours. Instead, you brought the baby 
                                        to your parents’ after being discharged.

                                        You were tired and scared to be pregnant again. You went to the hospital for an IUD insertion later.
