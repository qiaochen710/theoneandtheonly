                                Since kindergarten, your mom brought

                                mom took you to the community centre 
                                to learn piano. 
                                <br><br>
                                You sat in a big chair, and the teacher 
                                took a stool and placed it under your feet. 
                               “Keep your gesture like this, like holding 
                                an egg.” The teacher said patiently. 
                                <br><br>
                                But it was hard for you to do it well. 
                                What does it look like to hold an egg? 
                                You think. While tapping the piano keys with  
                                the gesture of “holding the egg” again and  
                                again, sleepiness kept coming to you. 
                                <br><br>
                                You tried so hard to keep your eyes open. 
                                But you failed. Your head dropped to one 
                                side from time to time.

                                    Actually, it’s kind of like that. When you are at home, you have to take care of her, help her dress, wash her, brush her teeth, and feed her. Mom and Dad also often say that you will be responsible for her education in the future since you know more than them. “In the future, when you have work, you will also need to support your sister.” Occasionally, when you go out with friends, you are also asked to come home early.

                                    After experiencing a child’s growth like this, you no longer want to have a kid in the future, it would be too exhausting.

Fell in love again.<br> 
Got married.
<br> <br>
From the age of 26, people around you started to urge you to have children, intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly. In a call with your mom, she urged you to have a baby. she said, 
“I went to the market to get groceries today and I passed by a children’s clothing store on my way home. The clothes inside are so cute.”
“Mom. You don’t need to urge me to have a baby like this.”<br>

                                    After you gave birth to the first child everyone around you was urging you to have a second one.
