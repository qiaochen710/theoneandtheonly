                                <br> <br>
                                The traditional dominance of the patriarch in your family has been replaced by a more equal parental partnership. Both your brothers are married and have children by the time you are in Middle School. They said one day, “We will pool our money to buy you a house or a car. You can repay us later.”

                                Only in your uncle do you detect any 
                                disapproval in your family that you are 
                                a girl, you can see it in his eyes.

                                as they aged is no longer the sole responsibility of sons.
